# typing-game-for-kids
This is my first game.  I'm just trying to get used to pygame while also teaching my children how to type their sight-word lists from school.

The tutorial I'm using for pygame-tutorial.py is located at https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/.  I am up to the Collision Detection stage.
